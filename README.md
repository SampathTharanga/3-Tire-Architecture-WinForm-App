# 3-Tier Architecture WinForm App

Welcome to the 3-Tier Architecture WinForm App repository! This repository contains a Windows Form Application built with a 3-tier architecture.

## Description

The 3-Tier Architecture WinForm App demonstrates the implementation of a 3-tier architecture pattern in a Windows Form Application. It separates the presentation layer (UI), business logic layer, and data access layer for better organization and maintainability.

## Features

- **3-Tier Architecture:** Follows a structured architecture with separate layers for presentation, business logic, and data access.
- **Windows Form UI:** Provides a user-friendly interface built with Windows Forms for interacting with the application.
- **Data Access:** Utilizes data access objects (DAOs) or repositories to interact with the underlying data store.
- **Modular and Scalable:** Architecture allows for easy scalability and maintenance of the application.
